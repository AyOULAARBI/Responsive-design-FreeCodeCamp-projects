<h1> Front-End Journey - FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Course </h1>
<br>
Welcome to my repository, where I'm documenting my journey to enhance my front-end development skills. 
As a full-stack web developer, <b></b>I've primarily focused on the backend</b>, but I'm now <b><i>
  committed to improving my front-end and
styling capabilities </i> </b>. To achieve this, I'm following the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Course, 
and I've already completed a series of projects, each project has a name and a number next to it for the sake of being organized.
<br>
<h2>How I'm Learning ?</h2>
Good question ! as developers we can't know everything so we usualy follow some tutorial to help us learn new technologies,
build projects ... the problem here is ...well you guessed it ! the <b>Tutorial Hell !</b> which is basically watching some
developer code and you try to understand the concepts, but when you open your code editor and try to code it yourself, using 
your own resoning,logic,creativity ... you get stuck ! the solution I found working well for me is For each project,
I follow these steps:
<br /><br/>
<ol>
  <li>I complete the project using the FreeCodeCamp editor, ensuring functionality and responsiveness.</li>
  <li>After finishing it there, I open Visual Studio Code and try to code it from scratch, applying what I've learned  <u>FROM SCRATCH</u> .</li>
  <li>I commit the code to this repository to track my progress.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Goals ! </h2>
<b>
  My primary goal is to not only make my web applications functional but also visually appealing.
  I'm learning responsive design principles, 
  CSS styling, and other front-end techniques to achieve this goal.

Thank you for joining me on this front-end development journey! ðŸš€
