<!-- 
    Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to
    https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks

    User Stories:

        You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's 
        main content (technical documentation).

        Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section.
        There should be a minimum of five.

        The first element within each .main-section should be a header element,
        which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

        Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the
        text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores .
        
        The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
        
        The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
        
        The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)

        You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
        The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic
        of the technical documentation.

        Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be 
        one for every element with the class main-section.

        The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar

        Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each
        section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains 
        the text "Hello world").
        
        When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc 
        element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates 
        to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header).

        On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of
         the screen and should always be visible to the user

            <p>Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point 
                for creating your application,allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.
            </p>

            <p>Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection,
                 an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your
                 first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the
                best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.
            </p>
            <p class="bold">A Progressive framework</p>
            <p>We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps
                into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, 
                guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and more. 
                Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.</p>
            <p class="bold">A Scalable Framework</p>
            <p>
                Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache 
                systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds
                 of millions of requests per month.
            </p>
            <p>
                Need extreme scaling? Platforms like Laravel Vapor allow you to run your Laravel application at nearly limitless
                 scale on AWS's latest serverless technology.
            </p>
            <p class="bold">A Community Framework</p>
            <p>Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly framework available. In addition,
                thousands of talented developers from around the world have contributed to the framework. Who knows, maybe you'll even 
                become a Laravel contributor.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="first_laravel_project">
            <header >First Laravel Project</header>
            <p>Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS,
                 PHP and Composer can be installed within minutes via Laravel Herd. In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.</p>
            <p>After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer <u>create-project</u> command:</p>
            <code>
                composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
            </code>
            <p>Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer. Or, if you installed
                 PHP and Composer via Laravel Herd, the Laravel installer is already available to you:</p>
            <code>composer global require laravel/installer
                <br><br>
                laravel new example-app</code>
            <p>After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:</p>
            <code>
                php artisan serve
            </code>
            <p>
                Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at <u>http://localhost:8000</u> .
                 Next, you're ready to start taking your <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#next-steps">next steps</a> into the Laravel ecosystem. 
                 Of course, you may also want to <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#databases-and-migrations">configure</a> a database.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="getting_started_on_windows">
            <header >Getting started on Windows</header>
            <p>Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make sure to install Docker Desktop. Next, you should ensure that 
                Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. WSL allows you to run Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. 
                Information on how to install and enable WSL2 can be found within Microsoft's developer environment documentation.</p>
            <p>After installing and enabling WSL2, you should ensure that Docker Desktop is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/">configured to use the WSL2 backend</a>.</p>
            <p>
                Next, you are ready to create your first Laravel project. Launch Windows Terminal and begin a new terminal session for 
                your WSL2 Linux operating system. Next, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.
                 For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:
            </p>
            <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>
            <p>
                Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric 
                characters, dashes, and underscores.
                 The Laravel application's directory will be created within the directory you execute the command from.
            </p>
            <p>Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application containers are built on your local machine</p>
            <p>After the project has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel
                Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:</p>
            <code>./vendor/bin/sail up</code>
            <p>Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: http://localhost.</p>
            <p>To continue learning more about Laravel Sail, review its <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail">complete documentation</a> .</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="initial_configurations">
            <header >Initial Configurations</header>
            <p>All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the <b>config</b> directory. Each option is documented, so feel free
                 to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.</p>
            <p>Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review
                 <b>the config/app.php</b> file and its documentation. 
                 It contains several options such as <b>timezone</b> and <b>locale</b> that you may wish to change according to your application.</p>
            <p class="bold">Environment Based Configuration</p>
            <p>
                Since many of Laravel's configuration option values may vary depending on whether your application is running on your local machine 
                or on a production web server,many important configuration values are defined using the .env file that exists at the root of your
                 application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your <b>.env</b> file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could
                 require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your 
                 source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.
            </p>
            <p>For more information about the <b>.env</b> file and environment based configuration, check out the full  <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration#environment-configuration">
                 configuration documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="bold">Databases & Migrations</p>
            <p>Now that you have created your Laravel application, you probably want to store some data in a database. By default, your application's <b>.env </b>
                configuration file specifies that Laravel will be interacting with a MySQL database and will access the database at <b>127.0.0.1</b> . If you are 
                developing on macOS and need to install MySQL, Postgres, or Redis locally, you may find it convenient to utilize <a href="">DBngin</a> .</p>
            <p>
                If you do not want to install MySQL or Postgres on your local machine, you can always use a SQLite database. <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite
                </a>  is a small, fast, self-contained
                 database engine. To get started, create a SQLite database by creating an empty SQLite file. Typically, this file will exist within the <b>database </b>
            directory of your Laravel application:</p>
            <code>touch database/database.sqlite</code>
            <p>Next, update your .env configuration file to use Laravel's sqlite database driver. You may remove the other database configuration options:</p>
            <code>
                <span style="display: block;background:lightgreen;color:#272727;padding:5px">DB_CONNECTION=sqlite </span>
                <div style="background-color: rgba(200,10,10,0.4); display:flex;flex-direction:column;padding:5px">
                    <span>DB_CONNECTION=mysql </span>
                    <span>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 </span>
                    <span>DB_PORT=3306 </span>
                    <span>DB_DATABASE=laravel </span>
                    <span>DB_USERNAME=root </span>
                    <span>DB_PASSWORD= </span>
                </div>
            </code>
            <p>Once you have configured your SQLite database, you may run your application's <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/migrations">database 
                migrations</a> , which will create your application's database tables:</p>
            <code>php artisan migrate</code>
            <p class="bold">Directory Configuration</p>
            <p>Laravel should always be served out of the root of the "web directory" configured for your web server. You should not attempt to serve a Laravel
                 application out of a subdirectory of the "web directory".Attempting to do so could expose sensitive files present within your application.</p>
            <p class="bold">IDE Support</p>
            <p>You are free to use any code editor you wish when developing Laravel applications; however, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/laravel/">
                PhpStorm</a>  offers extensive support for Laravel and its ecosystem, including Laravel Pint.</p>
            <p>In addition, the community maintained <a href="https://laravel-idea.com/">Laravel Idea</a> PhpStorm plugin offers a variety of helpful IDE 
            augmentations,including code generation, Eloquent syntax completion, validation rule completion, and more.</p>

            <header >Next Steps</header>
            <p>Now that you have created your Laravel project, you may be wondering what to learn next. First, we strongly recommend becoming familiar with how
                 Laravel works by reading the following documentation:</p>

            walk you through building your first Laravel application.</p>
            <p class="bold">Laravel The Full Stack Framework</p>
            <p>Laravel may serve as a full stack framework. By "full stack" framework we mean that you are going to use Laravel to route requests 
                to your application and render your frontend via <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade">Blade templates</a> or a single-page application hybrid technology 
                like <a href="https://inertiajs.com/">Inertia</a>. This is the most common way to use the Laravel framework, and, in our opinion, the most productive way to use Laravel.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/frontend">frontend development</a>,
                <a href="/docs/10.x/routing">routing</a>, <a href="/docs/10.x/views">views</a>, or the <a href="/docs/10.x/eloquent">Eloquent ORM</a>.
                 In addition, you might be interested in learning about community packages like <a href="https://livewire.laravel.com">Livewire</a> and
                 <a href="https://inertiajs.com">Inertia</a>. These packages allow you to use Laravel as a
                  full-stack framework while enjoying many of the UI benefits provided by single-page JavaScript applications.
            </p>
            <p>If you are using Laravel as a full stack framework, we also strongly encourage you to learn how to compile your application's CSS and JavaScript
                 using <a href="/docs/10.x/vite">Vite</a>.

            <p class="bold">Laravel The API Backend</p>
            <p>
            Laravel may also serve as an API backend to a JavaScript single-page application or mobile application. For example, you might use Laravel as an API 
            backend for your <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a> application. In this context, you may use Laravel to provide <a href="/docs/10.x/sanctum">
            authentication</a> and data storage / retrieval for your application, while also taking advantage of Laravel's powerful services such as queues,
             emails, notifications, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on <a href="/docs/10.x/routing">routing</a>,
